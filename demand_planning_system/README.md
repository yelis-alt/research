This paper is dedicated to the development of the planning system for demand in transport infrastructure for the industrial 
logistics operator JSK «RT-Logistics». In pursuit of this objective there has been conducted the analysis of the economic 
activity of the selected company, which includes the review of the organizational structure, competitive position, 
economic-financial position, logistics activity, obtained IT-infrastructure and the search for the problematic 
business processes so as to determine the dysfunctions to be reengineered in the field of the logistics activity planning. 
Apart from the analysis of the activity of the selected industrial logistics operator, there have been 
reviewed the theoretical approaches to logistics activity planning in companies supported with the thorough 
research of the real case-studies, approaches to the implementation of the forecast procedures, mathematical basis and 
functioning mechanisms of some forecast tools and there have been conducted the comparative analysis of them in order to 
make the final choice of the right combination of the reviewed elements deployed for the formation of the future 
individual planning system most suitable for the focal enterprise. The result of the conducted research is the developed 
planning system for demand in transport infrastructure that has been built with the platform for managing 
databases «DBeaver» and programming platform «RStudio» sided with the prepared code in the programming language «R». 
The high extent of the economy in the deployed human, financial and time resources is intrinsic for this developed 
planning system, which can be proven by formulated economic justification in the form of economic effect proposed 
by the introduction of this solution for the selected industrial logistics operator. The economic justification is 
based on the clients’ real transport applications that were captured by the information system during the specific 
period of time.
