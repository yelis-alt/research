This paper is dedicated to the development of the intelligent service for booking electric charging stations. Its scientific 
novelty lies in the introduction of the specifically designed mathematical model that solves the task of finding an optimal 
route considering the necessity for electric cars to visit charging stations following it. The solution is presented 
as a web application that interacts with several external web services and uses data of the users. In the framework of 
the creation of this web service the theoretical aspects of web development have been analyzed and research of the scientific 
practices related to the sphere of routing for electric transport has been conducted. Moreover, the methodological part that 
involves mathematical modelling all possible internal and external conditions of the task and introducing the objective function 
alongside with mathematical model according to the collected scientific material has been implemented. The practical part 
deals with the software implementation of the designed method and its following economic justification supported by the model of 
strategic profit applied to the real corporation. The web application is containerized, which enables it to be deployed on 
practically any personal computer.
